This package uses direct parametrisation to compute the complex normal form (CNF) of an infinite, nonlinear metamaterial chain system for analytical or semi-analytical nonlinear dispersion solutions.
For comparison purposes, two additional methods are included: the Method of Multiple Scales and the Harmonic Balance Method.

Before running the main script, please run install.m to add all necessary files to the MATLAB path.

This code also depends on two external packages: Nlvib v1.3 and the Tensor Toolbox.
•	Nlvib v1.3 is used for numerical continuation in the comparison examples.
•	The Tensor Toolbox is used for tensor calculations.
